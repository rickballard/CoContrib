# Outreach Flow (CoCivium / CoSuite)

## TL;DR
- Start with a **5-minute contribution ask**.
- Provide a **one-click edit path** (GitHub ✏️ → Commit changes).
- Offer a **tiny PR** task.
- Invite deeper engagement via **AdviceBomb** (zip-first).

## Roles
- **Seeders**: send the first wave of messages, ensure links work.
- **Shepherds**: reply, help recipients complete the 5-minute task, review PRs.
- **Archivists**: move artifacts to stable paths, keep the trail (CoSync notes).

## Sequence
1. Send **Outreach_Intro_Email (short)**.  
2. If interested, escalate to **long** version with AdviceBomb guidance.
3. Track responses in `outreach_targets.csv` (status + notes).
4. Shepherd the first contribution (edit → commit → PR).
5. If contributor has energy: point them to the AdviceBomb guide in CoCache.

## Quality bars
- **No coercion**: purely voluntary, transparent paths.
- **No crowns**: no gatekeeping, anyone can start small.
- **No corruption**: public trails, repo-first, audit-friendly.

## PR flow
- Small changes only; create short-lived branch; squash-merge; verify on `main`.
- Use meaningful, human-first commit messages; attach the email template in PR body if helpful.
