Subject: Welcome to CoCivium / CoSuite — your 5‑minute starter

Hi <Recipient>,

Welcome to the CoSuite: a hybrid society (human+AI) toolkit for trustworthy organizational systems and civic architectures.

Our ethos: **no corruption, no coercion, no crowns**. We’re “CoCivium,” an open‑source community working to *strengthen* democracy.

**Start here (5 minutes):**
1) Skim this checklist and tick items directly in GitHub (✏️ → Commit changes):  
   https://github.com/rickballard/CoContrib/blob/main/contributors/elias/ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md  
   If that page isn’t live yet, open the repo home and navigate to `contributors/elias/ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md`:  
   https://github.com/rickballard/CoContrib

2) Ship **one tiny build** (e.g., fix a line in `onboarding/Contributor-Guide.md`). Click ✏️, make the change, choose “Create a new branch and propose changes,” then **Open pull request**.

Optional (zip‑first pattern):  
https://github.com/rickballard/CoContrib/blob/main/training/README.md

If anything is unclear, WhatsApp me or improve the page you’re on and open a small PR. That’s all the contribution we need for now. :)

**Have more than 5 minutes? Try an AdviceBomb.**  
Ask your AI to argue a small idea with you, turn it into an advisory doc in a zip, and point your AI (sternly) at the guardrailed path:  
https://github.com/rickballard/CoCache/blob/main/advice/inbox/README.md

Thanks for bringing both empathy and engineering — you may not yet realize how qualified those superpowers make you. 🌱
