# How the CoSuite Compass fits our outreach

**Version:** 1.5 (2025-10-28 20:00:11 UTC)
**Maintainer:** CoCivium/CoSuite

## 1) Purpose
Make the Compass the **front-door explainer**; route readers to pilots, PRs, sponsorship.

## 2) Positioning
Audience: technical decision-makers, civic/gov innovators, startup builders, contributor prospects.
Promise: faster credible pilots with governance built-in (audit + migration).
Proof: scorecards, receipts, BPOE checklists, demo pilots.

## 3) Funnel (awareness → proof)
3.1 Awareness: Pages site; Substack; LinkedIn thread; 60-sec video.
3.2 Interest: “Pick-one-theme” CTA; link to 30-day plan; example scorecards.
3.3 Evaluation: Evidence packs, CI-checked tables, audit pack samples.
3.4 Conversion: Open an issue/PR to start a pilot; sponsor a theme; join Contributor repo.
3.5 Expansion: Publish results; add receipts; invite case-study co-authors.
