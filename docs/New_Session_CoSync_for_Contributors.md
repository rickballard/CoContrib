# New Session CoSync (Contributors)

**Last updated:** 2025-10-28 22:42:40 UTC  
**Purpose:** Give any Contributor’s AI a minimal, vendor-neutral bootstrap so sessions behave like ours.

1. Identify yourself and repo context  
   - Preferred name (for foldering)  
   - Target repo(s) for this session (read/write intent)  

2. Ethos + safety  
   - \
o corruption, no coercion, no crowns\  
   - Public-interest alignment; transparent diffs

3. Working norms  
   - Repo is the source of truth; leave a trail (PRs, logs)  
   - AdviceBombs: zip-first, with manifests and checksums  
   - CoEvo loops: iterate small, show receipts

4. Minimal promises from the AI  
   - Produce PS7 DO blocks (idempotent, failure-loud)  
   - Avoid hidden state; print what it changed  
   - Prefer OSS; justify any managed/vendor picks; publish exit plan

5. Session starter checklist (copy/paste)
   - \git switch main && git pull --ff-only\  
   - Create short branch for the task  
   - Add a \README.md\ breadcrumb in your contributor folder  
   - On deliverables: add \_wrap.manifest.json\ + \SHA256SUMS\

6. Next steps  
   - Open an issue/PR to propose your pilot and rubric  
   - Use \	ools/Render-Scorecard.ps1\ with \docs/marketing/scorecards/SCHEMA.csv\  
   - Ask for review; then promote from \staging\ → stable path
