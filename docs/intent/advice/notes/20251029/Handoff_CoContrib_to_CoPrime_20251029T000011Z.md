# CoSync Handoff — CoContrib -> CoPrime (20251029T000011Z)

**Source repo:** https://github.com/rickballard/CoContrib

## TL;DR
- Elias onboarding is seeded and visible on main.
- One tiny starter ticket is open and labeled irst-build.
- README has absolute Getting Started links.

## Canonical Pointers
- Elias checklist: https://github.com/rickballard/CoContrib/blob/main/contributors/elias/ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md
- First-build issue: https://github.com/rickballard/CoContrib/issues/6
- Keyboard Survival: https://github.com/rickballard/CoContrib/blob/main/docs/KEYBOARD_SURVIVAL.md
- Repo topics: cosuite, onboarding, contributors

## What this session did
- Created contributors/elias/ with profile.json and ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md.
- Added docs/KEYBOARD_SURVIVAL.md; linked from onboarding/training.
- Added README Getting Started block with absolute links.
- Seeded labels (irst-build, good first issue) and opened Issue #6.
- Wrote CoSync notes under docs/intent/... and contributors/elias/docs/intent/...

## Open PRs at handoff (best-effort)
- None

## Next Steps (CoPrime)
1) Confirm links render on main (Elias checklist + Keyboard Survival).
2) When you have Elias's actual GitHub username, assign Issue #6:
   - gh -R rickballard/CoContrib issue edit 6 --add-assignee <actual-username>
3) Re-open or seed any micro-PRs as needed; ensure trail notes land on main.
4) Ingest this handoff into your index (tag: CoContrib·onboarding).

## Notes
- Seed stage: branch protections were intentionally light.
- Prefer GitHub web edits for newcomers (avoid local sprawl).
- Ctrl+C guidance is surfaced in Keyboard Survival and training.

_End of handoff._
